### Introducation

Erlang (/ˈɜːrlæŋ/ er-lang) is a general-purpose, concurrent, functional programming language. It is also a garbage-collected runtime system. The sequential subset of Erlang supports eager evaluation, single assignment, and dynamic typing. Erlang is known for its designs that are well suited for systems with the following characteristics:

* Distributed
* Fault-tolerant
* Soft real-time
* Highly available, non-stop applications
* Hot swapping, where code can be changed without stopping a system

It was originally a proprietary language within Ericsson, developed by Joe Armstrong, Robert Virding and Mike Williams in 1986, but was released as open source in 1998. Erlang, along with OTP, a collection of middleware and libraries in Erlang, are now supported and maintained by the OTP product unit at Ericsson and have been widely referred to as Erlang/OTP.
