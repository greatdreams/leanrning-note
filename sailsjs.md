#### What's sails.js?

`Sails.js` is a web framework that makes it easy to build custom, enterprise-grade Node.js apps. It is designed to resemble the `MVC architecture` from frameworks like Ruby on Rails, but with support for the more modern, data-oriented style of web app development. It's especially good for building realtime features like chat.
